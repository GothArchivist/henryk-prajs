During breakfast, it was not the regiment’s commander but the squadron’s commanding officer at the time, given that the regiment was divided into smaller units as was the usual practice for the maneuvers because we could not all be in one location, who said: ‘Listen up soldiers! The war has started’. We were already hearing explosions because the railway station in Suwalki had been shelled in the morning. We knew what to do right away, we were advancing in battle formation from that moment onwards. We were told not to disperse. I mean we advanced in battle formation only. On the second of September, during the night, two squadrons, the fourth and the second under the command of Major Witkowski, were given the order to advance in the direction of the East Prussia towards Koenigsberg, today’s Kaliningrad, right? Koenigsberg. We set off at night in full battle formation, I mean, those two squadrons, horses and everything. We reached the village of Reuss, today’s Cimochy. There, we entered the German land. We advanced, left the horses in the wood behind a hill, and went to battle on foot. We did not encounter any resistance when entering Reuss. I think that we penetrated 5 to 7 km deep into the German territory. Depending from which direction, from Grajewo it would be some 7 km to the village of Reuss. We even went as far as..., I can’t remember, and later we stopped because we actually entered, what do you call it, or else"

At that point, we heard that one of our chevaux-légers had crawled up to that building where it the party was taking place. It must have been a club not a restaurant, not a bar, just a club because they were partying and dancing. And he threw in a grenade. There was havoc. I don’t know. Szyciński ? was the surname of that soldier who had thrown in the grenade, I remember it as if it were today, a senior chevau-leger. So havoc ensued and panic spread at that point. We took two Germans captive. We did. Of course, I was already present at the time because I had been summoned by the commanding officer to interpret for him as I spoke some German and could act as an interpreter. So we held them captive and later, we spent a few hours there, in the early hours the order came to retreat From that moment onward, the whole tragedy unfolded. In general, we could not stop anywhere during the day. We could not stop anywhere because planes were dropping bombs all the time. It was virtually impossible to... anywhere.

It was there that we encountered fierce resistance from the Germans.  Heavy fighting erupted and there was a major exchange of fire. Very many, very many of our soldiers died there, more than twenty. The commanding officer of our regiment was still with us, he was wounded near Olszewo and so was I, among others.  My immediate commanding officer, cavalry cadet Glusek, that was his name, died two meters away from me. I was covering him with my machine gun. I don’t know how it happened. Apparently, the Germans must have... a shrapnel exploded and I was wounded in my neck, leg and hand. I still have the scars. And he just collapsed and never got up. He was standing maybe two meters away from me. After that, I was no longer capable of fighting. They took me to, what was his..., no, no in inaudible, his name was, his name was, I also forgot that but maybe I can recall it later."

Sure, I had multiple injuries but not life-threatening ones. He sent me back to the encampent. That was on September 13th or 14th. The encampment no longer followed the regiment. The regiment went more to the east, later reached Klodzko and engaged the enemy there. They fought until October 5th, until the end. I wasn’t with the regiment during that period because I was wounded and we were sent in the direction of Grodno.  Our part of the unit went as far as Szczuczyn, Nowogrodzki. And there and there until September 17th. And we remained there, we were met by that army, we were disarmed by the Soviet Army and taken into captivity, no, I wasn’t taken prisoner on that day yet.

He worked at the Italian embassy and issued paperwork with the help of the Italian ambassador. They bribed the Gestapo or SS personnel. I don’t recall whom exactly.
