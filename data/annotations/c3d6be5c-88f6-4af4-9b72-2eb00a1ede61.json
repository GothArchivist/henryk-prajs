However, Gora Kalwaria differed from other towns... small provincial towns in that it was where the famous tzaddik from the Alter family lived and where very large conventions took place. Especially for holidays such as Yom Kippur, Rosh Hashanah, that is the New Year and Shavuot. Very many people would then come to Gora Kalwaria on a pilgrimage to see that tzaddik. That was precisely what distinguished Gora Kalwaria from other towns in Poland."

I was very young. How old could I have been at the time? Well inaudible, I could have been two or three years old, no more than that. So this could have even been in 1918, yes. So I don’t remember my father. I was raised. We were three children. Our mother was a seamstress. She tried very hard to give us any minimum education she could in the form of elementary school. At the time, it was called common school. I went to school as soon as I turned seven. I have very fond memories of my school time. Teachers were very friendly to us, in general to Jewish children. Overall, Gora Kalwaria was specific as there was no anti-Semitism during the pre-war period. The Polish and Jewish communities lived very well together."

Please note that the pilgrims rented flats there from poorer people. Among others, even though it was a single room my mother rented it out to earn a little money. And, among other things, the town hall also made some money as those who came to Gora Kalwaria had to pay one zloty per head to the town hall. During that that time when, let’s say that up to two thousand pilgrims arrived, the estimates would be larger. Not true. Because Gora Kalwaria had 7,000 residents and it could not accommodate more that than up to 2,000 persons. Because where would those people stay? Inaudible . They supplemented the state budget, that is the budget of Gora Kalwaria. The mayor was a very righteous man by the name of Dziejko ? who was truly held in high esteem by all Jews, not only by us. He was also a philosemite. For instance, he insisted that Jews put forward their own candidates for councillors during the election to the town council. We also had a very good police chief, in the final years. His name was Janica. It needs to be said that he, unfortunately, Gora Kalwaria also went through different times when Falanga  ultranationalist, patriotic and antisemitic political movement in Poland was active in the years 1937-8. In 1939, the war psychosis was already there and such excesses were less common. But the Jewish stands at fairs were still being destroyed and people were told ‘don’t buy from a Jew’. And they came from nearby towns like Warka, Grojec, Karczew or Otwock.  The police chief stressed: ‘Watch out Jews, you mustn't give in, defend yourselves by any means’. That police chief, he was just a very good man. Unfortunately, he died in Katyn.  The entire population deplored the fact that he had been killed there. We couldn’t help him in any way because during that time who would... nobody even knew it. He had left Gora Kalwaria like all policemen who went east and died there, the poor soul. We mourn his death till the present day. Whoever remembers Janica, mourns his death. Now, as far as I’m concerned, well, at the time..."
