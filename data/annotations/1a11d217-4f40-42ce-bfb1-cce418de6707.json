Declared illegal by the Second Republic of Poland after a few months’ operation, the organization went underground and continued its activities illegally with the support of extremist nationalist groups.1935 saw a split between the ‘moderate’ ONR, known as ‘ABC,’ and the ‘radical’ ONR known as ‘Falanga.’ The ONR exploited calls for an economic boycott during the severe economic crisis of the 1930s to drum up support among the masses and develop opposition to Pilsudski's government.
