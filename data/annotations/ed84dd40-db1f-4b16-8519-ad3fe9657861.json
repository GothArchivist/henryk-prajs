In general, to visit the tzaddiks' place. That's what of particular interest to them. The synagogue and the cemetery. What else is there to see? I tell them about the history of Gora Kalwaria. I tell them about everything. But those things have been so well documented that everybody knows about them. Even the youngest Jewish child knows what the Holocaust was. So when they come sometimes, I say certain things because there are some points, for instance [inaudible]. It may even be inappropriate for me to talk about it because in the Jewish religion we pray 'Blessed are you God who have not created me a woman'. And I ask them a question 'Me'ayin ata? Me'ayin at or ata?' [Where are you from?]. And she responds, 'I'm from Holon' or 'I'm from Tel Aviv'. And then I ask her 'Lo. Ima' 'Wo kommst du her?' [Where do you come from?] Like your mother.  They start laughing. Like I started laughing now. It just happens that I know Torah a little, a little because I studied it a bit. I can even speak some Hebrew, too. I talk to them and they are very pleased. You won't find a Jew in the whole of the Warsaw province. People tend to keep to themselves the fact that they are Jewish. From the whole of Warsaw. And Gora Kalwaria is privileged in the sense that everybody knows about us and they respect us.  We are well liked. Everybody likes us in Gora Kalwaria, whoever they are. Even Majewski who is a farmer. He owns many morgens of orchards. He is one of the best growers of fruit in the area. I also got involved in fruit growing some time ago when I stopped working as a tailor. I was a fruit grower. Well, I was."

          "text": "Subject: Well, what can I say to conclude? I wish you plenty of good health. I salute all residents of Gora Kalwaria. I'm truly happy that I can say that about you. I know that you respect me. I'm even emotional when I say it. And I say the same to all people of good will because there's nothing better than a good man. There's nothing better in the world than a man with good disposition when he is, when he is friendly toward people, animals and everything around us. Isn't this much more important than being biased. 'Look, here comes a Jew!' or 'Look, here comes a Gypsy!' [sic] or 'Look, here comes such and such!'. That is just ugly. There was also a man like that by the name of Wysocki in Gora Kalwaria after the war. I bore no grudge against him either. His experiences were similar to many others. I experienced his longing because he had survived. He behaved very decently during the Nazi occupation. He was not afraid of anybody. But he was lonely, lonely. That man died alone. Did I feel sorry for him? As a Jew, I felt sorry for him because it was a man who simply had nobody. He was alone. He died alone, alone. The Protestant cemetery in Gora Kalwaria is in terrible condition. It's a tragedy. Why? If you could see the state of the Jewish cemetery in Gora Kalwaria. It was demolished. It was demolished by no one else but the Poles. Shame on you, Poles, for demolishing that cem... park and building houses on the grounds. I'm on record here. These are the things that simply are not done. You're not allowed to do such things. This is a sacred place. Unfortunately, such were the people. Graves were dug up. If someone had been recently buried, they would have even stripped the body of the linen in early 1945. It's a shame! It's a shame for Catholic faith."
